# Energy Game ⚡

Energy Game is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript game designed to take away boredom at work!
We have periodic power outages for power maintenance and I built this so we all play locally and share high scores.

## 🚀 How to Play
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Navigate through the game and avoid obstacles.
- Collect energy boosts to score points.

## 🛠️ Installation
- Clone the repo:
